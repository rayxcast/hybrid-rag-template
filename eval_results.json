      "answer": "Yes. In Note 1 (Revenue Recognition), the company explains how advertising revenues are recognized, including a principal vs. agent distinction for Google Network properties. It states that:\n\n- For ads placed on Google Network properties, the company evaluates whether it is the principal (report revenues on a gross basis) or the agent (report revenues on a net basis).\n- Generally, advertising revenues on Google Network properties are reported on a gross basis, with amounts billed to customers recorded as revenues and amounts paid to Google Network partners recorded as cost of revenues.\n- If Alphabet is not the principal, the revenues are reported net.\n\nThis principal/agent nuance could be misinterpreted if one assumes all Google Network revenues are gross, since the note explicitly allows net presentation when Alphabet is not the principal. The note also describes timing for recognition of performance vs. brand advertising, which adds to potential confusion if read without the full context.\n\nSource: Alphabet Inc., Note 1.
